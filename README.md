# CPU Pipeline Simulator
CPU pipeline simulator in C that models instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback stages using a unified memory system. Integrated a flexible memory hierarchy into the processor pipeline, accurately simulating timing behavior, stalls, and memory access delays across multiple configurationsâ€”demonstrating deep understanding of CPU architecture, pipelined execution, and low-level performance modeling.
