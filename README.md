# CPU Pipeline Simulator
A CPU pipeline simulator in C that models the instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback stages using a unified memory system. Integrates a configurable memory hierarchy into the processor pipeline to simulate timing behavior, stalls, and memory access delays across varied configurationsâ€”capturing key aspects of CPU architecture, pipelined execution, and performance modeling.
